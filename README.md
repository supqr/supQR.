# supQR.

The goal of this project is to reduce time spent on support and the time needed in the onboarding process. This is especially useful for dynamic workplaces like a coworking space as there are often new coworkers joining which need rapid onboarding. But it could also be very useful in huge systems like the shanghai metro as there could be a QR-Code which would lead to a manual which would explain how you could charge your metro card. The problem of limited space to put text would easily be solved by that as the only thing that needs physical space would be QR-codes and the information behind the codes are accessible on every smartphone in whichever language is required.
